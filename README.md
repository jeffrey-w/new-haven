# New Haven

New Haven is a game based on the board game [of the same name](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/146158/new-haven).
Players take turns harvesting resources so that they may build their villages and attract villagers.

Resources are generated by forming connected chains of like resource types on a common game board. Buildings of certain
types may be built on individual village boards according to the resources available per turn, and must be built
adjacent to like types.

The player who has attracted the most villagers at the end of the game wins!
